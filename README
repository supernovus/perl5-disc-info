Disc::Info
------------

Gets optical disc information from an ISO-format disc (CD/DVD) or ".iso"
image file.

Using this on a physical disc only works in OSes where you can have a 
"file" representing the optical drive.  So Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc. 
I'm not sure if this is possible with Windows, if someone knows a way, 
let me know. Using it on an .iso file should work on any OS.

It returns a hash reference, populated with fields representing the disc info.

= Normal Fields =

  fs           An identifier for the ISO filesystem type.
  os           The system id of the disc.
  name         The volume label of the disc.
  setid        The volume set id (if any) of the disc.
  publisher    The publisher of the disc.
  preparer     The person or group who prepared this disc.
  appid        The application which created this disc.
  copyright    Copyright information (typically a file to read.)
  cdate        Creation date (as a DateTime object.)
  mdate        Modification date (as a DateTime object.)
  edate        Effective date (as a DateTime object.)
  xdate        Expiry date (either a DateTime object, or 0 if no expiry.)

= Offset Fields =

These fields are typically not needed directly, and are used internally to
set the timezone on the date fields they represent. However, they are
available to query, and will contain the offset in a HHMM string format,
such as "-0800" or "+0530".

  coff         Creation date timezone offset.
  moff         Modification date timezone offset.
  eoff         Effective date timezone offset.
  xoff         Expiry date timezone offset.

= Usage =

  use Disc::Info;
  my $cd = get_disc_info("/dev/cdrom");
  say $cd->{name}." was created in the year ".$cd->{cdate}->year;

= Runtime requirements =

 * Perl 5    (tested with 5.12.4)
 * DateTime  (tested with 0.70)

= Testing requirements =

 * Test::More
 * Test::Exception
