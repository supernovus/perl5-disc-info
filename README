Disc::Info
------------

Gets optical disc information from an ISO-format disc (CD/DVD) or ".iso"
image file.

Using this on a physical disc only works in OSes where you can have a 
"file" representing the optical drive.  So Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc. 
I'm not sure if this is possible with Windows, if someone knows a way, 
let me know. Using it on an .iso file should work on any OS.

= Object Oriented Usage =

Create an object, that offers methods you can query.

  use Disc::Info;
  my $disc = Disc::Info->load("/dev/cdrom");
  say $disc->name." was created in the year ".$disc->date->year;

It offers the following methods:

  os           The system id of the disc.
  name         The volume label of the disc.
  setid        The volume set id (if any) of the disc.
  publisher    The publisher of the disc.
  preparer     The person or group who prepared this disc.
  appid        The application which created this disc.
  copyright    Copyright information (typically a file to read.)
  date         Creation date (as a DateTime object.)
  created      Alias of 'date', see above.
  modified     Modification date (as a DateTime object.)
  effective    Effective date (as a DateTime object.)
  expires      Expiry date (either a DateTime object, or 0 if no expiry.)
  filesystem   An identifier for the ISO filesystem type.
  offset       The offset for a given date field ('created' by default.)
               In a +/-HHMM format, i.e.: -0800 or +0530


= Procedural Usage =

It returns a hash reference, populated with fields representing the disc info.

  use Disc::Info 'get_disc_info';
  my $disc = get_disc_info("/dev/cdrom");
  say $disc->{name}." was created in the year ".$disc->{cdate}->year;

Offers the following fields:

  fs           An identifier for the ISO filesystem type.
  os           The system id of the disc.
  name         The volume label of the disc.
  setid        The volume set id (if any) of the disc.
  publisher    The publisher of the disc.
  preparer     The person or group who prepared this disc.
  appid        The application which created this disc.
  copyright    Copyright information (typically a file to read.)
  cdate        Creation date (as a DateTime object.)
  mdate        Modification date (as a DateTime object.)
  edate        Effective date (as a DateTime object.)
  xdate        Expiry date (either a DateTime object, or 0 if no expiry.)
  coff         Creation date timezone offset (in HHMM format.)
  moff         Modification date timezone offset (in HHMM format).
  eoff         Effective date timezone offset (in HHMM format.)
  xoff         Expiry date timezone offset (in HHMM format.)
